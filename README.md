# Hi I'm Cesferort ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m a programmer interested in software and video game development. Now that I am
finishing my studies, I would love to become part of a company where I can test my
knowledge and develop professionally. 

## Currently 
IÂ´m currently working on three video games, one of them will be presented as a final degree project. Will announce more information as time progresses.

## Awards
My desire to do something new and different has led me to two awards: 
<ul>
  <li>Second place in the STARTinnova competition 2016</li>
  <li>Most innovative project in the XVIII Young Entrepreneurs 2016, offered by the Nebrija University</li>
</ul>
